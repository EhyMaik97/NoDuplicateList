# NoDuplicateList
Small script that helps me with a task at work.
It takes as input a list of numbers (separated by space) and returns a list without duplicates, separated by commas and this sequence is enclosed between two square brackets

P.S. I don't care sorting the list 

# Exemple
Input: 2 4 54 65 23 3 3 51 2 4 

Output: [65, 2, 3, 4, 51, 54, 23]

# Graphic 
To make it simpler and more intuitive I used a Python library, called tkinter, which allows you to create small graphical interfaces.
